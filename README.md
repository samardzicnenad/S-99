# S-99
This repo is my attempt to stay active in Scala programming by solving the 99 problems presented on [**S-99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems**](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/) page.  
My intentions is to enable users to run all of the examples in two modes:  
- with themselves providing the arguments in the program call
  - a list should be provided as: **(**element_1,element_2,....,element_n**)**
- by running the program with the built-in arguments  
  
Here's the list of the problems:  
- P01: Find the last element of a list.
  - expects one command line argument - a list
- P02: Find the last but one element of a list.
  - expects one command line argument - a list
- P03: Find the Kth element of a list.
  - expects two command line arguments - a list and an integer
