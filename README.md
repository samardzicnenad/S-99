# S-99
This repo is my attempt to stay active in Scala programming by solving the 99 problems presented on [**S-99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems**](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/) page.  
My intentions is to enable users to run all of the examples in two modes:  
- with themselves providing the arguments in the program call
- by running the program with the built-in arguments  
  
Here's the list of the problems:  
- P01: Find the last element of a list.
